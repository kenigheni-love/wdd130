        Hi! I’m Love Kenigheni, a software development student at BYU–Idaho,
        passionate about building practical, real-world solutions through code.
        I'm currently learning the fundamentals of web development and exploring
        how technology can be used to solve everyday problems. I'm also enrolled
        in a Professional Foundations program to sharpen both my soft and
        professional skills. This website is part of my journey — a space where
        I document what I’m learning, practice new skills, and grow one project
        at a time.

      <p>
        Nigeria stands out for its rich culture, diverse people, and vibrant
        spirit. From music and fashion to food and resilience, it’s a country
        full of life and color.
